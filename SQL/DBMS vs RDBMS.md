To understand the differences between DBMS and RDBMS, it is necessary to understand how they store data and manage the database. Here are a few differences between the two: 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Database Management System (DBMS)**|**Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**|
|**Primary Purpose**|DBMS stores, modifies, and extracts data from a database.|RDBMS organizes data into related tables and uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to maintain data integrity.|
|**Data Storage**|The data storage is in file format, which makes it more difficult to work with large amounts of data.|The data storage is in tabular format, which makes it easier to work with large amounts of data.|
|**Data Access**|A basic DBMS will offer individual access to data, meaning that it allows each user to access only the data that is relevant to them.|RDBMS offers access to data as a whole, meaning that it allows all users to access the entire database as a single entity.|
|**Distributed Database Support**|It does not support distributed databases because this system inherently lacks access to data spread across multiple physical locations (or nodes).|It supports distributed databases through features like data partitioning, replication, and distributed query optimization.|
|**Connection Between Data**|Since data is in a file format, there is no connection between different data files.|The tabular form of the data enables the data to link together.|
|**Data Storage Quantity**|Due to the lack of structured and relational capabilities and limitations in handling complex databases, DBMS can only store small quantities of data or small datasets.|Since RDBMS is “relational” in nature, storing data in a structured format (tables, rows, and columns) can handle diverse and connected data effectively, making it suitable for storing large amounts of data across numerous nodes.|
|**Data Normalization**|Data normalization is in charge of organizing a database’s data, minimizing data redundancy, and preserving data integrity. To carry out data normalization, the DBMS lacks a number of normal forms.|Normalization in RDBMS involves breaking down complex data into related tables using a series of normal forms. These forms eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity by defining rules for data. Common forms include First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and so on.|
|**Data Redundancy**|Duplicate records or duplication of data in a DBMS is common because of the absence of data normalization property, thereby hampering data integrity.|An RDBMS places more emphasis on data normalization, eliminates the possibility of data redundancy, and enhances data integrity.|
|**User Access**|A simple DBMS typically only supports one user at a time and lacks the complex mechanisms needed to effectively manage multiple users’ simultaneous interactions.|It makes certain that multiple users can interact with, modify, and query the database at once without interfering with one another.|
|**Data Security**|Data breaches are possible because DBMSs have inadequate encryption, weak authentication, rudimentary authorization controls, and limited security measures.|RDBMS offers data security by allowing for authentication, authorization, and encryption. Users provide credentials for authentication, and access is restricted based on roles and permissions by authorization controls.|
|**Hardware Requirement**|Because it can work efficiently with a simple computer system with enough memory and storage, DBMS has relatively low hardware requirements.|RDBMS has a high hardware requirement because it supports distributed databases across multiple nodes, which necessitates high-performance systems with robust servers, powerful processors, and plenty of memory.|
|**Popular Examples**|MySQL, Microsoft Access, [IBM Db2](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2/database?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700075363270914&p5=e&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoeemBhCfARIsADR2QCtlkJTHZkG_gmTe2RkJSDd8VmQOGmrDnzl07Vm6XL2Ukiiy77mY8agaAkFFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)|Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB.|
