1. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)  
2. Paragraphs (`<p>`)  
3. Bold, Italic, Underline (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`)  
4. Lists: Ordered (`<ol>`), Unordered (`<ul>`), and Description (`<dl>`)  
5. Line breaks (`<br>`) and horizontal lines (`<hr>`)

Practice:

1. Create an HTML page with different types of text formatting and lists.  
2. Experiment with ordered and unordered lists inside each other.
