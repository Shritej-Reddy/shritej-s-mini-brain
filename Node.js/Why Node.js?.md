# 1. API

Node.js allows developers to write real-time applications while providing scope for mobile application development in JavaScript. The most popular type of application — API services — expose JSON objects with a REST API for the client to consume.

# 2. Streaming web applications

Node.js has a built-in streams module which allows it to transmit a huge amount of data in chunks, sequentially. That is why it is perfect for services for listening to music or watching videos without the need to download the content.

# 3. Real-time web applications

Thanks to the event loop API and WebSockets it is possible to build real-time web applications like chat, video conference room or collaboration tools helping coworkers to work on the same document at the same time (like GoogleDocs).

# 4. Microservices

Apart from that, Node can also be used to build microservices — applications as a collection of small services working independently.

### 5. Language sharing across the stack

### 6. Rapid Development

### 7. The Node Package Manager

### 8. Single-threaded event loop architecture is ideal for microservices

### 9. Native support in AWS
