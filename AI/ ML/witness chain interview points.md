1. Telegram - uses end to end encryption, although not a blockchain enabled architecture is seeing a lot of backlash. How does that make you guys feel in terms of how the world might look at a decentralised architecture in the future.
2. Many governments are a bit wary of a decentralised architecture cause they then lose control of accessing the data mid transfer to check for terrorist/ illegal activities. Now they cant access this data cause since the architecture is decentralised they would have to maybe get permissions from many countries to access the data.
